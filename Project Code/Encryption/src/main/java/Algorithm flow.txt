In the dot product calculation, given a point P on an elliptic curve and an integer k, the result of kP is calculated.
This process can be achieved by repeatedly performing the addition operation, but traditional dot product algorithms can lead to excessive computation, especially when k is very large.
An improved dot product algorithm reduces the computation by breaking k into a simple sequence of elementary operations.
This code implements the following function:
Uses a secp256k1 curve as an elliptic curve parameter.
Generates a random private key and the corresponding public key.
implements an improved dot product algorithm for computing k times a point on a curve.
Provides the method getDomainParameters() for accessing elliptic curve parameters.
